# ND-repo

first, create a file folder you wish to store the application

ensure you have downloaded git and node.js. I downloaded the latest (2.43.0) version of git and node v21.6.1-x64.msi

open command prompt, make your way into the folder

To clone the repository, use git clone https://github.com/jacobsa20/nd-repo.git

cd into ND-repo

npm install

npx expo start -c

Once the app is running, you may choose a photo or use the default photo and add an emoji to the photo.
You may save or restart your process as many times as you like, the counter will keep track of how long you have been on the app.


Wishes for this app:
My wish for this app is to expand into a collage-style application with compatibility for both 
vertical and horizontal photos. The app will be able to accept multiple photos, move the photos
to overlap one another, add multiple emojis, and save the collage. I would create a photo to replace 
the default photo that explains how to use the app.
